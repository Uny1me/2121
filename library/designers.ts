    bio: "Zainab is a fashion designer who has always enjoyed storytelling. Using her clothes and prints to communicate her story or that of someone else within the black experience has always fuelled her creations. Zainab is currently studying at Central Saint Martins (BA Fashion Print), she created an intimacy with colours, and construction and allowed her research to grow as she discovered more about herself, as she tackles both making and her emotions towards her chosen storyline (concept). The story never ends the way it started. And it allows you, the audience of her work, to see different narratives. As a black artist, she shares her experience with you that she embraces and preciously carries into her projects and hopefully future collections.",

    bio: "African art has been perceived through a lens of Orientalists and consumption has often been framed by patronizing, neo-colonial narratives of charitable support. African artisans often experience unfair pricing and are barred from access to sales, due to the infrastructure dominated by the Global North. Legacy, at its ethos, not only works to shine a light on the output of African creatives and potential but also operates as a fair trade marketplace to bring the artisans monetary profit and recognition for the original creation.",
